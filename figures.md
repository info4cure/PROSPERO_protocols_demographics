       xlim=c(0, 3), ylim=c(0, max(len.1, len.2)),
       axes=F, xlab="", ylab="") # Remove axes and labels
  points(rep(2, len.2), 1:len.2, pch=19, cex=0.3, tck=-.01)

  # Now we need to map where the elements of a are in b
  # We use the match function for this job
  a.to.b <- match(a, b)
  
  # Now we can draw arrows from the first column to the second
  arrows(rep(1.02, len.1), 1:len.1, rep(1.98, len.2), a.to.b, 
         length=arrow.len, angle=20)

##  A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW ADDRESSING EXPERIMENTS WITH HEALING OF SKIN WOUNDS IN RATS USING LLDLT WITH DIFFERENT ACTIVE MEANS SEEKING TO IDENTIFY A PATTERN IN ADJUSTMENTS SUCH AS LASER WAVELENGTH, POWER AND FLUENCY AND ANALYSING WOUND HEALING PARAMETERS, SUCH AS WOUND AREA, PRESENCE OF FIBROBLASTS, ANGIOGENESIS, LEUKOCYTE INFILTRATION, EPITHELIAL COVERAGE AND ANTIBACTERIAL EFFECT. IT WAS PERCEIVED THAT A PROTOCOL DOES NOT EXIST IN VIEW OF THE WIDE VARIATION IN THE USE OF POWER (9 TO 500 MW) AND FLUENCY (1 TO 60 J/CM2); HOWEVER, BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT WAVELENGTHS, THE HIGHLIGHT WAS THE COMBINED USE OF RED AND INFRARED WAVELENGTHS SHOWING BETTER RESULTS THAN WHEN USED ALONE.

##  ACUTE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION (AMI) IS A MEDICAL EMERGENCY IN WHICH SUDDEN OCCLUSION OF CORONARY ARTERY(IES) RESULTS IN ISCHEMIA AND NECROSIS OF THE CARDIAC TISSUES. REPERFUSION THERAPIES THAT AIM AT REOPENING THE OCCLUDED ARTERY REMAIN THE MAINSTAY OF TREATMENT FOR AMI. PRIMARY PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTION (PCI), WHICH ENABLES THE RESTORATION OF BLOOD FLOW BY REOPENING THE OCCLUDED ARTERY(IES) VIA A CATHETER WITH AN INFLATABLE BALLOON, IS CURRENTLY THE PREFERRED TREATMENT FOR AMI WITH ST SEGMENT ELEVATION (STEMI). THE DOOR-TO-BALLOON (D2B) DELAY REFERS TO THE TIME INTERVAL COUNTING FROM THE ARRIVAL OF A PATIENT WITH STEMI AT A HOSPITAL TO THE TIME OF THE BALLOON INFLATION (OR STENT DEPLOYMENT) THAT REOPENS THE OCCLUDED ARTERY(IES). REDUCING THIS DELAY IN PRIMARY PCI IS THOUGHT TO BE AN IMPORTANT STRATEGY TOWARD ACHIEVING BETTER PATIENT OUTCOMES. UNFORTUNATELY, SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION OF D2B DELAY IN THE USA OVER THE LAST DECADE HAS NOT BEEN SHOWN TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVED STEMI MORTALITY. IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED THAT THE LACK OF IMPACT COULD BE DUE TO THE EXPANDING USE OF PRIMARY PCI IN STEMI AS WELL AS THE SURVIVAL COHORT EFFECT, LEADING TO A SHIFT TOWARD A HIGHER RISK POPULATION RECEIVING THE PROCEDURE. OTHERS HAVE SUGGESTED THAT REDUCTION IN D2B DELAY MAY NOT BE AS IMPACTFUL AS EXPECTED, GIVEN THAT IT ONLY REPRESENTS A SMALL FRACTION OF THE TOTAL ISCHEMIC TIME. ALTHOUGH MOST EXISTING EVIDENCE HAVE POINTED TO THE PRESENCE OF A BENEFICIAL EFFECT OF SHORTER D2B DELAY, SOME INCONSISTENCIES HOWEVER EXIST. THIS STUDY AIMS TO SYNTHESIZE AVAILABLE EVIDENCE IN ORDER TO ANSWER THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS: (1) WHAT IS THE OVERALL EFFECT OF D2B DELAY ON CLINICAL OUTCOMES IN PATIENTS WITH STEMI TREATED WITH PRIMARY PCI? (2) WHAT FACTORS EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCES OF THE EFFECT ESTIMATES AMONG THE STUDIES? (3) WHAT ARE THE IMPORTANT STRENGTH AND LIMITATION OF THE EXISTING BODY OF EVIDENCE?</ABSTRACTTEXT>: ACUTE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION (AMI) IS A MEDICAL EMERGENCY IN WHICH SUDDEN OCCLUSION OF CORONARY ARTERY(IES) RESULTS IN ISCHEMIA AND NECROSIS OF THE CARDIAC TISSUES.

##  A QUARTER OF ALL BIRTHS IN THE UK ARE TO MOTHERS BORN OUTSIDE THE UK. THERE IS ALSO EVIDENCE THAT IMMIGRANT WOMEN HAVE HIGHER MATERNAL AND INFANT DEATH RATES AND OF INEQUALITIES IN THE PROVISION AND UPTAKE OF MATERNITY SERVICES/BIRTH CENTRES. THE TOPIC IS OF GREAT SIGNIFICANCE TO THE NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE BECAUSE OF DIRECTIVES THAT ADDRESS INEQUALITIES AND THE CHANGING PATTERNS OF MIGRATION TO THE UK.

##  A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW ADDRESSING EXPERIMENTS WITH HEALING OF SKIN WOUNDS IN RATS USING LLDLT WITH DIFFERENT ACTIVE MEANS SEEKING TO IDENTIFY A PATTERN IN ADJUSTMENTS SUCH AS LASER WAVELENGTH, POWER AND FLUENCY AND ANALYSING WOUND HEALING PARAMETERS, SUCH AS WOUND AREA, PRESENCE OF FIBROBLASTS, ANGIOGENESIS, LEUKOCYTE INFILTRATION, EPITHELIAL COVERAGE AND ANTIBACTERIAL EFFECT. IT WAS PERCEIVED THAT A PROTOCOL DOES NOT EXIST IN VIEW OF THE WIDE VARIATION IN THE USE OF POWER (9 TO 500 MW) AND FLUENCY (1 TO 60 J/CM2); HOWEVER, BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT WAVELENGTHS, THE HIGHLIGHT

##  ACUTE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION (AMI) IS A MEDICAL EMERGENCY IN WHICH SUDDEN OCCLUSION OF CORONARY ARTERY(IES) RESULTS IN ISCHEMIA AND NECROSIS OF THE CARDIAC TISSUES. REPERFUSION THERAPIES THAT AIM AT REOPENING THE OCCLUDED ARTERY REMAIN THE MAINSTAY OF TREATMENT FOR AMI. PRIMARY PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTION (PCI), WHICH ENABLES THE RESTORATION OF BLOOD FLOW BY REOPENING THE OCCLUDED ARTERY(IES) VIA A CATHETER WITH AN INFLATABLE BALLOON, IS CURRENTLY THE PREFERRED TREATMENT FOR AMI WITH ST SEGMENT ELEVATION (STEMI). THE DOOR-TO-BALLOON (D2B) DELAY REFERS TO THE TIME INTERVAL COUNTING FROM THE ARRIVAL OF A PATIENT WITH STEMI AT A HOSPITAL TO THE TIME OF THE BALLOON INFLATION (OR STENT DEPLOYMENT) THAT REOPENS THE OCCLUDED ARTERY(IES). REDUCING THIS DELAY IN PRIMARY PCI IS THOUGHT TO BE AN IMPORTANT STRATEGY TOWARD ACHIEVING BETTER PATIENT OUTCOMES. UNFORTUNATELY, SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION OF D2B DELAY IN THE USA OVER THE LAST DECADE HAS NOT BEEN SHOWN TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVED STEMI MORTALITY. IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED THAT THE LACK OF IMPACT COULD BE DUE TO THE EXPANDING USE OF PRIMARY PCI IN STEMI AS WELL AS THE SURVIVAL COHORT EFFECT, LEADING TO A SHIFT TOWARD A HIGHER RISK POPULATION RECEIVING THE PROCEDURE. OTHERS HAVE SUGGESTED THAT REDUCTION IN D2B DELAY MAY NOT BE AS IMPACTFUL AS EXPECTED, GIVEN THAT IT ONLY REPRESENTS A SMALL FRACTION OF THE TOTAL ISCHEMIC TIME. ALTHOUGH MOST EXISTING EVIDENCE HAVE POINTED TO THE PRESENCE OF A BENEFICIAL EFFECT OF SHORTER D2B DELAY, SOME INCONSISTENCIES HOWEVER EXIST. THIS STUDY AIMS TO SYNTHESIZE AVAILABLE EVIDENCE IN ORDER TO ANSWER THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS: (1) WHAT IS THE OVERALL EFFECT OF D2B DELAY ON CLINICAL OUTCOMES IN PATIENTS WITH STEMI TREATED WITH PRIMARY PCI? (2) WHAT FACTORS EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCES OF THE EFFECT ESTIMATES AMONG THE STUDIES? (3) WHAT ARE THE IMPORTANT STRENGTH AND LIMITATION OF THE EXISTING BODY OF EVIDENCE?</ABSTRACTTEXT>: ACUTE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION (AMI) IS A MEDICAL EMERGENCY IN WHICH SUDDEN OCCLUSION OF CORONARY ARTERY(IES) RESULTS IN ISCHEMIA AND NECROSIS OF THE CARDIAC TISSUES.

##  AIM: THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO PRESENT THE RESEARCH PROTOCOL OF A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW ABOUT FALL RISK ASSESSMENT TOOLS IN ACUTE HOSPITALIZED PATIENTS.BACKGROUND: VARIOUS RISK ASSESSMENT TOOLS FOR FALLS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED, BUT WITH UNCERTAINTIES DERIVED FROM VALIDATION IN HETEROGENEOUS ENVIRONMENTS AND VARIATIONS IN THEIR SENSITIVITY, SPECIFICITY AND PREDICTIVE VALIDITY.DESIGN: SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS.METHODS: TWO INDEPENDENT REVIEWERS WILL EXTRACT DATA IN A BLINDED PROCESS. QUALITY OF STUDIES WILL BE ASSESSED USING VARIOUS STANDARDIZED INSTRUMENTS. A META-ANALYSIS WILL BE PERFORMED IF APPLICABLE. FOR ALL STUDIES, SENSITIVITY, SPECIFICITY, POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE PREDICTIVE VALUES, TOGETHER WITH THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE LIKELIHOOD RATIOS AND YOUDEN INDEX WILL BE CALCULATED. THE DIAGNOSTIC ODDS RATIO OF THE STUDIES AND THE HIERARCHICAL SUMMARY RELATIVE OPERATING CHARACTERISTIC CURVE AND BIVARIATE MODEL WILL BE APPLIED. CALCULATIONS WILL BE MADE FROM RANDOM EFFECTS MODELS. FOREST-PLOT DIAGRAMS FOR SENSITIVITY AND SPECIFICITY AND LIKELIHOOD RATIOS, IN ADDITION TO COCHRANE'S Q TEST AND THE I(2)  STATISTIC, WILL BE CALCULATED. FUNDING OF THE REVIEW WAS CONFIRMED IN DECEMBER 2010.DISCUSSION: THE RESULTS OF THIS REVIEW WILL HELP TO CLARIFY SOME UNCERTAINTIES PROVOKED BY EARLIER RESEARCH FINDINGS AND ENABLE INFORMED CHOICE OF A VALIDATED, REPRODUCIBLE INSTRUMENT FOR ASSESSING THE RISK OF FALLS BY HOSPITAL PATIENTS, SO THAT PREVENTIVE ACTION MAY BE TAKEN TO MINIMIZE THIS RISK.

##  AIM: THE PURPOSE OF THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW IS TO EVALUATE THE EFFICACY OF DIFFERENT LENGTHS OF TIME OF POSTOPERATIVE DRESSING REMOVAL IN THE HEALING OF SURGICAL WOUNDS BY PRIMARY INTENTION.BACKGROUND: IT IS GENERALLY PRACTICED AND RECOMMENDED IN CLINICAL GUIDELINES TO COVER SURGICAL INCISIONS WHICH ARE HEALING BY PRIMARY INTENTION POSTPROCEDURE. HOWEVER, THE TIMING OF DRESSING REMOVAL IN RELATION TO THE PREVENTION OF SURGICAL SITE INFECTIONS HAS NOT YET BEEN SUFFICIENTLY EXAMINED.METHODS: THE SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSES WILL BE PERFORMED ACCORDING TO THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE COCHRANE HANDBOOK FOR SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS OF INTERVENTIONS. RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS WILL BE INCLUDED. COMPARISONS WILL BE MADE BETWEEN DIFFERENT DURATIONS OF LEAVING DRESSINGS IN PLACE, INCLUDING NOT DRESSING THE SURGICAL SITE AT ALL, AND COVERING WOUNDS UNTIL SUTURE REMOVAL. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE IS THE RATE OF SURGICAL SITE INFECTIONS. FUNDING OF THE REVIEW WAS CONFIRMED IN MARCH 2010.DISCUSSION: THE RESULTS OF THE REVIEW CAN PUT THE TIMING OF DRESSING REMOVAL FOR WOUNDS WHICH ARE HEALING BY PRIMARY INTENTION INTO PERSPECTIVE. BECAUSE OF THE WIDESPREAD USE OF SURGICAL DRESSINGS, CLINICAL PRACTICE COULD BE CHANGED IN VARIOUS SETTINGS.

##  AIM: THIS MIXED-METHOD SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AIMS TO ESTABLISH THE CURRENT EVIDENCE BASE FOR 'KEEP FIT', EXERCISE OR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY INTERVENTIONS FOR CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE WHO USE WHEELCHAIRS.BACKGROUND: NURSES HAVE A VITAL HEALTH PROMOTION, MOTIVATIONAL AND MONITORING ROLE IN OPTIMIZING THE HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF DISABLED CHILDREN. CHILDREN WITH MOBILITY IMPAIRMENTS ARE PRONE TO HAVE LOW PARTICIPATION LEVELS IN PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, WHICH REDUCES FITNESS AND WELL-BEING. EFFECTIVE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY INTERVENTIONS THAT ARE FUN AND ENGAGING FOR CHILDREN ARE REQUIRED TO PROMOTE HABITUAL PARTICIPATION AS PART OF A HEALTHY LIFESTYLE. PREVIOUS INTERVENTION PROGRAMMES HAVE BEEN TRIALLED, BUT LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE MOST EFFECTIVE TYPES OF EXERCISE TO IMPROVE THE FITNESS OF YOUNG WHEELCHAIR USERS.DESIGN: MIXED-METHOD DESIGN USING COCHRANE SYSTEMATIC PROCESSES. EVIDENCE REGARDING PHYSIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTIVENESS, HEALTH ECONOMICS, USER PERSPECTIVES AND SERVICE EVALUATIONS WILL BE INCLUDED AND ANALYSED UNDER DISTINCT STREAMS.METHODS: THE PROJECT WAS FUNDED FROM OCTOBER 2012. MULTIPLE DATABASES WILL BE SEARCHED USING SEARCH STRINGS COMBINING RELEVANT MEDICAL SUBHEADINGS AND INTERVENTION-SPECIFIC TERMS. ARTICLES WILL ALSO BE IDENTIFIED FROM ANCESTRAL REFERENCES AND BY APPROACHING AUTHORS TO IDENTIFY UNPUBLISHED WORK. ONLY STUDIES OR REPORTS EVALUATING THE EFFECTIVENESS, PARTICIPATION EXPERIENCES OR COST OF A PHYSICAL ACTIVITY PROGRAMME WILL BE INCLUDED. SEPARATE ANALYSES WILL BE PERFORMED FOR EACH DATA STREAM, INCLUDING A META-ANALYSIS IF SUFFICIENT HOMOGENEITY EXISTS AND THEMATIC ANALYSES. FINDINGS ACROSS STREAMS WILL BE SYNTHESIZED IN AN OVERARCHING NARRATIVE SUMMARY.DISCUSSION: EVIDENCE FROM THE FIRST SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF THIS TYPE WILL INFORM DEVELOPMENT OF EFFECTIVE CHILD-CENTRED PHYSICAL ACTIVITY INTERVENTIONS AND THEIR EVALUATION.

##  AIM: TO DESCRIBE A PROTOCOL FOR A QUANTITATIVE SYSTEMATIC REVIEW, TO IDENTIFY CRITIQUE AND SUMMARIZE FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE SELF-MANAGEMENT EDUCATION.BACKGROUND: SELF-MANAGEMENT EDUCATION ENABLES PATIENTS TO MANAGE THEIR CONDITION SUCCESSFULLY AND IT IS ASSOCIATED WITH BETTER SELF-CARE, GOOD CONTROL OVER LIFESTYLE AND LEADING THE BEST POSSIBLE QUALITY OF LIFE, NOTWITHSTANDING THE PRESENCE OF A CHRONIC DISEASE. TYPE II DIABETES IS A CHRONIC DISEASE THAT REQUIRES LIFESTYLE ADJUSTMENTS AND DISEASE MANAGEMENT TO KEEP GLYCAEMIA AND LONG-TERM COMPLICATIONS UNDER CONTROL. EDUCATION HAS TO BE CUSTOMIZED AND BASED ON AN ASSESSMENT THAT INCLUDES FACTORS INFLUENCING SELF-MANAGEMENT, SUCH AS PERSONAL CHARACTERISTICS THAT CAN OPTIMIZE THE EDUCATIONAL INTERVENTION.DESIGN: THE PROTOCOL FOR THE SYSTEMATIC REVIEW WAS CONDUCTED ACCORDING TO THE GUIDELINES OF THE CENTRE FOR REVIEWS AND DISSEMINATION, YORK (UK).METHOD: THE REVIEW QUESTION WAS DEFINED IN TERMS OF POPULATION, INTERVENTIONS, COMPARATORS, OUTCOMES AND STUDY DESIGNS. THE PROTOCOL INCLUDED DECISIONS ABOUT THE REVIEW QUESTION, INCLUSION CRITERIA, SEARCH STRATEGY, STUDY SELECTION, DATA EXTRACTION, QUALITY ASSESSMENT, DATA SYNTHESIS AND PLANS FOR DISSEMINATION. FUNDING FOR THE REVIEW WAS CONFIRMED ON JANUARY 2011 BY THE CENTRE OF EXCELLENCE FOR NURSING SCHOLARSHIP IN ROME.DISCUSSION: AN INITIAL SUMMARY WILL BE MADE BY TABULATING THE DATA; THE REVIEW WILL BE REPORTED IN A NARRATIVE STYLE AND BE DEVELOPED ACCORDING TO THE PRISMA GUIDELINES. THE PROTOCOL FOR THE SYSTEMATIC REVIEW WILL ALLOW US TO IDENTIFY, AMONG THE FACTORS INFLUENCING SELF-MANAGEMENT IN PEOPLE WITH TYPE II DIABETES, THE PERSONAL CHARACTERISTICS MOST RELEVANT TO THE FACTORS OF MOTIVATION AND EMPOWERMENT. IN ADDITION, THE SYSTEMATIC REVIEW WILL ALSO IDENTIFY AN APPROPRIATE SELF-MANAGEMENT MODEL.

Rank discrepancies between two ordered lists of reviewers' affiliation countries. The 'Unique protocols' column displays a descendent list of reviewers' affiliation countries that  produced protocols for which all reviewers' institutions belonged to an unique country. The 'Collaborative protocols' column displays a ranked list of reviewers' affiliation countries that collaborated with other reviewers' affiliation countries to produce protocols for SRs. Arrows connect the same country from first to second list. Countries represented only in one of the lists are not connected to/by any arrow. 

The final plot appearing in the manuscript was edited using Keynote to get countries sub-grouped (Q1:Q4) by cutting through 25\%, 50\%, and 75\% of total number of countries in each list. When comparing 'Unique protocols' and 'Collaborative protocols' lists, country position is considered being modified if the edge connects two different subgroups (i.e., Q1\rightarrow\text{Q3}).\hspace{0.1cm} Direction\hspace{0.1cm} of\hspace{0.1cm} the\hspace{0.1cm} change\hspace{0.1cm} defines\hspace{0.1cm} 'upgrading'\hspace{0.1cm} (Q2\rightarrow Q1,Q3\rightarrow Q1,Q4\rightarrow Q1, Q3\rightarrow Q2,Q4\rightarrow Q3)\hspace{0.1cm} or\hspace{0.1cm} 'downgrading' \hspace{0.1cm}the \hspace{0.1cm}rank \hspace{0.1cm}position\hspace{0.1cm}of\hspace{0.1cm}any\hspace{0.1cm}country \hspace{0.1cm}(Q1\rightarrow Q2,Q1\rightarrow Q3,Q1\rightarrow Q4,Q2\rightarrow Q3,Q2\rightarrow Q4,Q3\rightarrow Q4).

Countries are listed in a descendent order based on their 'Unique protocol' productivity. Points represent a hallmark in every country's history of protocol publication: first time to publish a protocol in 'only a journal' (red dot), 'only at PROSPERO' (green triangle), and in both 'journal and PROSPERO' (blue square). 

The final plot appearing in the manuscript was edited using Keynote to get arrows connecting two (by a dotted line) or more (by a full line) hallmarks to emphasize how much time is taken for a country to adopt a new way of publication.
